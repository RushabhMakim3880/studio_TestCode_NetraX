![NETRA-X Banner](https://placehold.co/1200x300.png)

**A modular, AI-enhanced platform for advanced, simulated cybersecurity operations.**

---

## Overview

NETRA-X is a sophisticated web application designed to serve as a comprehensive command and control (C2) center for educational and professional cybersecurity training. It integrates a full suite of offensive (Red Team) and defensive (Blue Team) tools, enhanced by generative AI, to provide a realistic and interactive learning environment.

From planning multi-stage phishing campaigns and generating custom malware concepts to analyzing logs and assessing vulnerabilities, NETRA-X offers a centralized platform to simulate and manage the entire cybersecurity lifecycle.

## Key Features

The platform is organized into distinct modules, each catering to a specific phase or function of a security operation.

-   **Metadata Scrubber**: Analyze and simulate scrubbing EXIF data from images to prevent information leaks.
-   **Google & Shodan Dorking**: Generate advanced search queries to discover exposed assets and information.

### üî¨ Defensive & Analysis Suite
-   **Log & Config Analysis**: Use AI to parse log files (Apache, Syslog) and infrastructure configurations (Nginx, Dockerfile) to find anomalies and misconfigurations.
-   **Malware Analysis**:
    -   **VirusTotal Integration**: Scan file hashes against the VirusTotal database.
    -   **Client-Side Analyzer**: Extract strings and calculate hashes of files entirely within the browser.
    -   **AI Yara Rule Generator**: Create Yara rules from natural language descriptions of malware characteristics.
-   **Vulnerability Assessment**:
    -   **CVSS v3.1 Calculator**: Score vulnerabilities based on standard metrics.
    -   **AI Exploit Chain Assistant**: Analyze how multiple vulnerabilities can be chained together for greater impact.

### ü§ñ Project & Platform Management
-   **AI-Powered Assistance**: Genkit integration leverages Google's Gemini models for context-aware tips, report generation, and strategic planning.
-   **Customizable Dashboard**: A command center with widgets for monitoring activity, project progress, and threat intel.
-   **Project & Task Management**: Plan campaigns, create tasks (manually or with AI), and assign them to team members with a Gantt chart timeline view.
-   **Document Generation**: Automatically create professional documents like Statements of Work (SOW) and Letters of Reconnaissance (LOR).

## Tech Stack

-   **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router)
-   **Language**: TypeScript
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
-   **Generative AI**: Google's Gemini models via Genkit
-   **Real-time Communication**: Firebase (Firestore)
-   **Authentication**: Custom JWT-based auth with role-based access control (RBAC)

## üöÄ Getting Started: Setup Guide

Follow these steps carefully to set up and run NETRA-X on your local machine.

### Step 1: Prerequisites

-   **Node.js**: Version 18 or later.
-   **npm** (or yarn/pnpm).
-   **Python 3**: Required for the optional Nmap wrapper script.
-   **Nmap**: Required for the optional Nmap wrapper script.
-   **(Optional) Ollama**: For running AI features locally. [ollama.com](https://ollama.com)

### Step 2: Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/netra-x.git
    cd netra-x
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Step 3: Firebase Setup (Required for Core Features)

The chat and real-time collaboration features depend on Firebase.

1.  **Go to the Firebase Console**: [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2.  **Create a Project**: Click **Add project**, give it a name, and accept the terms. You can disable Google Analytics.
3.  **Create a Web App**: In your project dashboard, click the Web icon (`</>`). Register the app with a nickname.
4.  **Get Config Keys**: After registering, Firebase will display a `firebaseConfig` object. You need these values.
5.  **Create `.env` File**: In the root of your project, create a file named `.env`.
6.  **Populate `.env` File**: Copy the keys from your `firebaseConfig` object into the `.env` file. **Crucially, add `NEXT_PUBLIC_` before each key name.**

    Your `.env` file should look like this (with your actual values):
    ```env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY="AIza..."
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="your-project-id.firebaseapp.com"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="your-project-id.appspot.com"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="..."
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID="1:..."
    ```

7.  **Enable Firestore & Storage**:
    -   In the Firebase console, go to **Build > Firestore Database**. Click **Create database**, select a location, and start in **Test mode**.
    -   Go to **Build > Storage**. Click **Get started** and start in **Test mode**.

### Step 4: Third-Party API Keys (Optional but Recommended)

To enable all OSINT and analysis features, add these keys to your `.env` file.

```env
# Get from https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey (for AI features)
GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"

# Get from https://www.virustotal.com/ (for hash scanning)
VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY="YOUR_VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY"

# Get from https://www.whoisxmlapi.com/ (for Whois lookups)
WHOIS_API_KEY="YOUR_WHOIS_API_KEY"

# Get from https://intelx.io/ (for data breach searches)
INTELX_API_KEY="YOUR_INTELX_API_KEY"
```

### Step 5: Nmap Wrapper Setup (Optional)

For advanced network scans (SYN, OS Detection), you need to run a local Python wrapper.

1.  **Install Python libraries**:
    ```bash
    pip install flask python-nmap
    ```
2.  **Run the script**: A script is provided in the `Advanced Network Scanner` component UI. Save it as `nmap_api.py` and run it from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python nmap_api.py
    ```
    For `sudo`-required scans, you may need to run `sudo python nmap_api.py`. The script runs a local server on port 5000 that NETRA-X communicates with.

### Step 6: Running the Application

1.  **Start the Development Server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

2.  **Access the Application**: Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

3.  **Log In**: You can log in with the default credentials (e.g., `admin` / `password123`).
