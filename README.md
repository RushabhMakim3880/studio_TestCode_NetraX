  - **Phishing Simulator:** Clone webpages, inject credential harvesters, and launch campaigns.
  - **Campaign Management:** Plan, execute, and monitor phishing campaigns against target profiles.
  - **Payload Generation:** Create custom malware concepts, DuckyScript, reverse shells, and more with AI assistance.
  - **C2 via Telegram:** Use Telegram for simple, effective command and control.
  - **Live Session Hijacking:** Inject JS payloads to monitor user activity, capture keystrokes, and exfiltrate data in real-time.

- **üîç Intelligence Gathering (OSINT):**
  - **Comprehensive Recon:** Perform WHOIS lookups, DNS queries, and subdomain scanning.
  - **Data Breach Analysis:** Check emails and domains against breach compilations via IntelX.
  - **Profile Analysis:** Generate simulated intelligence reports from social media profiles and scrub metadata from images.

- **üî¨ Defensive & Analysis Suite:**
  - **Malware Analysis:** Scan file hashes against VirusTotal and perform client-side analysis to extract strings.
  - **Log & Config Analysis:** Use AI to parse log files and infrastructure configurations for anomalies and misconfigurations.
  - **Vulnerability Assessment:** A suite of tools including a CVSS calculator and an AI Exploit Chain Assistant.

- **ü§ñ AI-Powered Assistance:**
  - **Genkit Integration:** Leverages Google's Gemini models for a wide range of tasks, from code generation to data analysis.
  - **Context-Aware Tips:** Provides helpful tips based on the user's role and current module.
  - **Automated Reporting:** Generate executive summaries and charts for operational reports.

- **üìà Project Management & Reporting:**
  - **Centralized Dashboard:** A customizable command center with widgets for monitoring activity, project progress, and threat intel.
  - **Task Management:** Plan projects, create tasks (manually or with AI), and assign them to team members.
  - **Document Generation:** Automatically create professional documents like Statements of Work (SOW) and Letters of Reconnaissance (LOR).

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **Generative AI:** Google's Gemini models via Genkit

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project and add your API keys. These are crucial for the application's intelligence and AI features to function.

    ```env
    # Get from https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
    GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"

    # Get from https://www.virustotal.com/
    VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY="YOUR_VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY"
    
    # Get from https://www.whoisxmlapi.com/
    WHOIS_API_KEY="YOUR_WHOIS_API_KEY"
    
    # Get from https://intelx.io/
    INTELX_API_KEY="YOUR_INTELX_API_KEY"
    ```

### Running the Development Server

1.  **Start the Genkit AI tools (in a separate terminal):**
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:dev
    ```

2.  **Start the Next.js development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. You can log in with the default credentials (e.g., `admin` / `password123`).

## Deployment

This application is optimized for deployment on platforms that support Next.js, such as **Vercel** or **Netlify**.

To deploy on Vercel:
1.  Push your code to a GitHub repository.
2.  Import the repository into Vercel.
3.  **Crucially, add the same environment variables listed above in the Vercel project settings.**
4.  Deploy! Vercel will handle the build process automatically.
