# **App Name**: NETRA-X Core

## Core Features:

- Splash Screen: Splash screen: A terminal-style loading animation, with the NETRA-X and any additional branding logos, loading bar, and progress metrics.
- User Authentication: Login and Registration: Users should be able to log in with existing credentials, or create new accounts. Forms should support username/password input, and potentially OTP sent via e-mail.
- Role Management: Role-Based Access Control: Limit and grant access based on user roles (Admin, Analyst, Operator, Auditor).  All functions or modules inaccessible to the current user should not appear, or be greyed out, disabled, or otherwise made un-clickable and unresponsive.
- Navigation Menu: Sidebar Navigation: A collapsible sidebar provides quick access to all available modules and settings.
- Configuration Manager: Settings Panel: Enable or disable modules and customize the app via a simple settings panel, and use JSON to save or load these configurations.
- Guidance System: Context-Aware Tips: Provide tool-tips giving users friendly but professional advice, customized to the current role, and module being used. These may come from a set of canned responses, or incorporate dynamic information and analysis provided by an AI tool.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark gray-blue (#343A40) to provide a professional and secure feel, reminiscent of command-line interfaces and cybersecurity tools.
- Background color: Very dark gray (#212529), near-black, to reduce eye strain in dark environments and align with the preferred dark theme.
- Accent color: Electric cyan (#79ffef) to highlight interactive elements, CTAs, and important information, providing a futuristic touch and clear visual cues.
- Body font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, to ensure readability and a modern, neutral appearance.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a sans-serif font, used for headings to give a techy, scientific feel that still allows the user to easily read any heading that they are seeing
- Use a set of clear, consistent icons for navigation and module representation, such as those from FontAwesome or similar icon libraries. These should align with the cyber theme: lock, shield, terminal, server etc.
- Maintain a modular layout, using cards or panels for different functions. Make use of collapsible elements to manage screen real estate, since the interface will be information-dense.
- Subtle animations and transitions, particularly on the splash screen and when switching between modules, would improve user experience.
